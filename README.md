## [Roataway](https://roataway.md) tracks public transport in Moldova's capital, a city of roughly _half a million residents_.

- we rely on an [open protocol](https://github.com/roataway/api-documentation)
- we don't track our users
- we don't show ads

## Why contribute?
- Your work is in the spotlight - public transport is used hundreds of thousands of times per day.
- Sustainability - public transport is critical infrastructure, your code might serve society decades into the future.
- Low-hanging fruits - there are plenty of [beginner-friendly feature requests](https://github.com/roataway/roataway-web/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), even small changes have a tremendous impact.
- Lots of things to do - programming, testing, copy-writing, translations, graphic design, UX design, you name it! This is a cross-disciplinary project, and you can assist in many ways.
- Unmatched bragging rights - this will impress potential employers, your friends and even your enemies!
